## Project Scope

As part of the process of unrusting my progamming hands and mind, i've taken on a project of testing out varying AI Tools, editors, agents, etc to build solutions for problems i find. 
This project is for me to explore what it actually takes to get an ai to play a very specific game for me. There are already tools to build AI npcs, but not players.
